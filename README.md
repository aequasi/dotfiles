My OS X .dotfiles
========

Basic settings for bash and vim.  Should work in other *nix systems.  

Includes a Terminal.app [profile](gruvbox/Gruvbox_Colors.terminal) to (roughly) match the [Gruvbox VIM Color Theme](https://github.com/morhetz/gruvbox).

####Install:

1. Clone the repo into your home directory, with the `--recursive` option
2. Back up any dot files you want to keep / don't want overwritten
2. Run the included bash script `./install.sh` to copy the files into your home directory
